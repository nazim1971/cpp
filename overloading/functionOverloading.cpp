// Write a C++ program to demonstrate function overloading with the following functionalities:
// Addition of two integers: The function should take two integer arguments and return their sum.
// Multiplication of two floating-point numbers: The function should take two float arguments and return their product.
// Subtraction of an integer from a float: The function should take a float and an int argument and return their difference (float - int).
