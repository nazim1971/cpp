# C++ OOP Practice Repository

This repository contains various C++ programs and examples to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, and other C++ concepts. It is designed as a collection of small, focused exercises and code snippets to help improve understanding of key C++ features.

## Topics Covered
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and using classes, constructors, destructors, and member functions.
- **Encapsulation**: Demonstrating private, public, and protected access specifiers.
- **Inheritance**: Single, multiple, and multi-level inheritance examples.
- **Polymorphism**: Function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Memory Management**: Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and smart pointers.
- **Other Concepts**: Friend functions, templates, exception handling, and file I/O.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nazim1971/cpp-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
   ```

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

## Contributions
Feel free to fork the repository, add new examples, or improve existing ones. Contributions are welcome!
